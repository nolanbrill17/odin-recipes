        <p>Butter Noodles is one of my favorite recipes, though it doesn't really 
            merit the name of being a recipe due to how easy it is!</p>
        <p>Growing up, this was one of my comfort foods, and I still eat it at least once 
            a week when I need a quick meal. Don't be frightend of one of the three ingredients and
            <strong>DO NOT</strong> overcomplicate this meal by emulsifying the pasta water into the butter.
            You're making butter noodles, not a stupid versian of a Roman pasta dish.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>~80g of cheap pasta, I like spaghetti but usually use a forkable type like fusilli</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of regular butter</li>
            <li>Shitty parm, aka the green topped bottle (please don't use freshly grated!)</li>
            <li>salt for water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Boil the water. Once it comes to a boil, drop in the pasta and cook to the time on the box.</li>
            <li>Strain the pasta.</li>
            <li>Toss the butter into the still hot pot and melt it. Add the pasta to the pot and stir to coat in butter. Add parmasean. Stir.</li>
            <li>Plate in a cheap plastic bowl and if you're feeling fancy crack some fresh pepper on it. Maybe airfry some dino nuggets too.</li>
        </ol>
