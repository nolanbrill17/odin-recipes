    <h1>Rice recipe</h1>

    <img src="../images/rice.jpeg" alt="short grain rice, cooked, in a bowl">

    <p>Really good rice is both more complicated and more simple than it seems, but either way you slice it,
        it all starts with buying good rice. For short grain rice, I really like the Botan rice, but you can 
        definitely find better rice out there.
    </p>

    <p>What makes rice really good (and simplifies the process) is buying a rice cooker. They aren't expensive these days
        and are easy to find. More importantly they make the best rice you'll ever have and they're very easy to operate.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>75g of Botan short grain rice</li>
        <li>100g of water</li>
        <li>literal pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Begin by washing the rice until the water runs clear. I usually rince the rice about 4-5 times before I feel good about it</li>
        <li>Add the water to the rice in the rice cooker pot. Follow the rice water/rice ratio. Add a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Make sure the rice cooker pot is in the rice cooker. Turn it on. Once it clicks into warm, remove the rice and fluff it.</li>
    </ol>
